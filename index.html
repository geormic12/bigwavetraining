                  First, we create a powerful AI environment on your laptop that
                  superpowers you for the entire course. Then we put it to work
                  immediately - talk to it like a colleague and watch it build
                  and publish a real website before lunch.

              The first time AI builds something real on your computer - not in
              a chat window, but an actual file you can open - everything
              shifts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suddenly websites aren't something you pay developers for. Apps
              aren't something you hire agencies to build. Automation isn't
              something that requires an IT department.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have the environment. AI has the skills. You can unleash AI in
              whatever direction you want.
            </p>
            <p class="transformation-emphasis">
